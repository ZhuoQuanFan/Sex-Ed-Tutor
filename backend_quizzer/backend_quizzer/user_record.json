I have had a lot of support from her to explore my gender and sexuality more, (hence the question mark on the male thing) but my gender is a whole other question though cause right now I\u2019m more concerned with my sexuality. My girlfriend is bisexual and has been in relationships with girls and non binary people in the past so obviously she can say she\u2019s bisexual. I\u2019m starting to think I\u2019m bisexual but I find it really hard know where the line is cause it\u2019s not that obvious. I\u2019ve always been attracted to women and had crushes on women but men are a little more complicated. I\u2019ve had certain guys that looking back on now I have felt some attraction to but the main thing is 99% or 98% of the time if I\u2019m attracted to a dude they have to look at least somewhat feminine. I just don\u2019t know if the qualifier of \u201chas to look feminine\u201d makes my sexuality be better classified as something like bi-curious or straight adjacent.

Though, we don\u2019t care about porn so a little bit ago I masturbated to the twinks subreddit but a solid amount of them I could not find attractive but I did find some of them kind of attractive. One thing I notice though is the more I focus on their masculine traits the less attractive they become (usually). I also wonder if some of it is internalized homophobia from my southern Christian upbringing cause I noticed that even looking at the gay porn got me nervous and I only started to like some it after I calmed myself down.

It's a connection that feels extraordinarily deep, perhaps somewhere between platonic and romantic. You start to notice that your heart races just a bit faster when he smiles at you, that his touch lingers a moment longer than necessary, and that your conversations have taken on an inexplicable depth.\n\nYou wonder what it would mean to embrace this relationship fully, whether expressing your true self could deepen your bond even further. Could it become a queer platonic relationship, a unique blend of deep emotional intimacy and companionship without the conventional labels of romance? As you contemplate this, you imagine the possibility of traveling together without pretense, talking freely about your identities, and exploring a bond that defies traditional categories.\n\nIn this scenario, you are both on a journey\u2014not just across physical landscapes but through the complex terrain of human emotions and relationships.

It also wouldn't help that I have almost severe social anxiety and it would put me in a completely worse mental state if it ever got out, not to mention I'm already in a vulnerable state anyway. As you can see, I am absolutely devastated by this thought and have tried all I could to make sure that my sister can't use any of my social media accounts as blackmail If there are any other things I have missed that could be used against me, please let me know and share some advice on how to further handle the situation I'm in, specifically how to further hide this info from the rest of my family.

She hadn\u2019t come out to her family before meeting me though so we were keeping it a secret for about 6 months. She finally came out to them in January and they were shocked/confused but weren\u2019t super mad or hateful. They are VERY religious so this was a huge shock for us as we were expecting the worst. They\u2019ve invited me to small get togethers like recitals and graduations and it\u2019s been fine and they\u2019re friendly but me and my gf have been very scared of acting like anything but friends in front of them. Flash forward to the 4th of July. They have a lake house and invited us out to it and to spend a few days out there. Her dad told her that she was to have no PDA and that we would have to sleep in separate rooms (he also said these were the rules for any couple) so we agreed. We get there and her brother and his fianc\u00e9 are kissing, snuggling on the couch, holding hands and even snuggling and making out on the boat. We were questioning this and that nothing was said but we really didn\u2019t think much about it since we\u2019re trying to still be comfortable around her family together. Out of habit, she put her hand on my leg on the boat and at one point put her arm around me. Mind you, her brother and his fianc\u00e9 are RIGHT next to us doing much more\u2026 well she gets talked to as soon as we get off the boat that this was unacceptable behavior and we needed to stop immediately because her dad was \u201cshaking\u201d seeing it. This pissed us both off and she went to talk to them some more. Her dad told her he told her brother the same thing after he talked with her earlier so we felt a little better but it still sucked. They also kept bringing up the fact that she \u201clied\u201d to them about not telling her she was gay when she realized it a few years back, so they\u2019re super hurt. Well we went to talk to her brother and he said he never got talked to. We decided to leave since they were not being fair to us because we are two girls.", "time_stamp": "2024-09-23 15:51:51.179333+08:00Asia/Shanghai"}, {"message": "what's PFLAG\n", "tutor_message": "Feel free to ask!", "correct_answer": "", "user_id": 1444, "imgs": [], "post_id": [417], "cloze_test": "", "multiple_choices": [], "mention_ui_elements": [], "wiki": [], "isImage": false, "state": "fail to understand", "sender": "user", "options": [], "sentTime": "just now", "direction": "outgoing", "explanation": "", "correct_answers": [], "query": "", "time_stamp": "2024-09-23 15:52:10.461612+08:00Asia/Shanghai"}, {"message": "Show me comments", "tutor_message": "", "correct_answer": "", "user_id": 1444, "imgs": [], "post_id": [417], "explanation": "", "cloze_test": "", "multiple_choices": [], "mention_ui_elements": [], "wiki": [], "isImage": false, "state": "fail to understand", "sender": "user", "options": [], "sentTime": "just now", "direction": "outgoing", "correct_answers": [], "isGpt": false, "query": "", "time_stamp": "2024-09-23 15:52:15.546592+08:00Asia/Shanghai"}], "correct": 0, "total": 0}, {"user_id": 1445, "post_id": [], "questions": [{"message": "I have some questions to ask!", "tutor_message": "That\u2018s all, Do you wanna more knowledge about this topic?
